# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over. These
may include:

- 30 jan
- simple color scheme, primarily black and white
- HTML

## Internal: Involuntary

- I will provide an honest representation of my current skill levels in HTML
- 9AM-5PM

## Internal: Voluntary

- I will maintain a consistent coding style and follow good programming
  practices for clean and readable code.
- I commit to spending dedicated time on my portfolio to ensure steady progress.
- My portfolio will use a simple color scheme, primarily black and white, to
  achieve a clean and minimalist design.
