## Must-Haves

> these are necessary for basic usability

- [ ] As the portfolio owner, I want to create a homepage that provides an
      overview of my skills and professional background so that visitors can
      quickly understand my expertise.
  - _Given that I am on my portfolio homepage, when I review the content, then I
    should see a clear presentation of my skills and a brief introduction._

## Should-Haves

> these will complete the user experience, but are not necessary

- [ ] As the portfolio owner, I want to showcase a portfolio section
      highlighting my key projects and achievements so that visitors can see the
      practical application of my skills.
  - _Given that I navigate to the "Projects" section, when I click on a project,
    then visitors should see detailed information including project description,
    technologies used, and any relevant links or images._

## Could-Haves

> would be really cool ... if there's time

- [ ] As the portfolio owner, I want to include a blog or updates section to
      share my thoughts, insights, or updates related to my field so that
      visitors can engage with my content regularly.
  - _Given that I navigate to the "Blog" section, when I add a new post, then
    visitors should see the latest content and have the option to comment or
    share._
